//Project: front-end website build using HTML5/CSS
Theme: Restaurant

Here is a project part of my University module. I was reuqired to design a friendly user-interface in relation to our discussed lectures with interest. We are required to choose a topic of our choice.  

  

Navigational features: 

The site is consitent through easy navigation. The site conists of four main 
pages excluding the external Github/google map links. The four main links home, about, menu, 
and contact reduces complexity and clutter for the user giving an overall user-friendly expericence. 
All the main information can be found at the top in the header of the site including 
nav-links, contact and location. 

The site is fully navigational and responsive for desktop and mobile users. CSS media-queries
have made this possible. To test, shrink the browser to a mobile dimension. I have ensured 
the site is fully functional for mobile, with size fitting to the screen and adjusted 
navigation-link layouts to column to suit mobile.

Design features:

Hovering animations from CSS show the user they are onto a clickable link. This effect can be
found in the four main links. The contact page itself has additional feautres in the form section.
e.g. when the user is entering an email or clicks on the box, the browser will dropdown saved email adreesses, 
saving the user time from writing out a whole email. The layout itself is visible and drops down when clicking. 

Letter spacing animations can be found when hovering over the links, which is inline with the theme of the site.

parallax scrolling feautre is implemented on the home page. The image of the fries stays in the
backround whilst the user scrolls down, creating depth to the sense of immersion in the 
virtual experience. 

skewed header is used to give the site a modern look in the about, contact and menu page. 
Most modern sites use this technique as it has become easier to implement. 


Fonts and icons have been implemented to match the theme of the site.
